Short term plans
================

* Revamp the configdrive networking definition.

Long term ideas
===============

* Change Bifrost to utilize inventory data instead of a CSV file, possibly something along the lines of nodes with-in an ironic group to be created if they do not already exist, and have configuration asserted based upon the inventory.
